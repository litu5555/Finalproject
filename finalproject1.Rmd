## Introduction
1.Package: ggmap, rvest, ape

2.Data source: 

  * www.trulia.com (one of housing price website in the United States)

  * Google Map API 

3.The method of getting data: 

  * using the package(rvest) to grab the house data from the www.trulia.com, because it will take a long time if you get the record from the website by inputting to the table by yourself. So the package(rvest) is a good choice to get the data in the HTML file by identifying the CSS selectors where the data stores in. From the www.trulia.com, I want to get the attributes about the address, price, and the coordinates. The address and the price can get from the HTML page directly by the package. But the coordinates in the website are also from the Google map API, in order to get the coordinates of houses, I use the function geocode()* from the package(ggmap). Inputting the address name into the function geocode(), and the function will send the requires to the Google map API, and then download the coordinates(lon,lat) of the address automatically. Eventually, joining the columns of address, price, lon and lat together to build the final data table(Buffalo_House_Price).

  * Keeping the same coordinate system between Buffalo_House_Price table and the boundary of Buffalo city. Plotting the house price distribution result(Not done yet).

4. Analyzing the spatial auto correlation of the house price by the package(ape) and calculate the Moranâ€™s I by R(Not done yet).

Geocode()*: the function can download the coordinates 2500 times a day.

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r,data collecting,echo=FALSE}
#In order to get the housing price in the www.trulia.com, seearch the key word "buffalo", then get the urls below:
#https://www.trulia.com/NY/Buffalo/=https://www.trulia.com/NY/Buffalo/1_p/
#https://www.trulia.com/NY/Buffalo/2_p/
#https://www.trulia.com/NY/Buffalo/3_p/
#...
#https://www.trulia.com/NY/Buffalo/78_p/
#Url from Buffalo/ to Buffalo/78_p, which means tha there are 62 searching result pages for the housing price in the buffalo. 

Buffalo_House=data.frame(Name=character(0),price=numeric(0),lon=numeric(0),lat=numeric(0))
Buffalo_House
for(i in 1:2){ 
  #geocode()function link the google map API to get the adress's location, but it just can get nearly 2500 location a time.
  #So here just downloading the first 3 web pages data as an example.
  url=sprintf("https://www.trulia.com/NY/Buffalo/%s_p/",i)
  housingPriceLink<-read_html(url,encoding="UTF-8")
  price<-housingPriceLink %>% html_nodes("#resultsColumn ul li .cardPrice") %>% html_text()#"#resultsColumn ul li .cardPrice"is the CSS selectors in the HTML page.
  Name<-housingPriceLink %>% html_nodes("#resultsColumn ul li .addressDetail") %>% html_text()
  coordinate<-geocode(Name, output = c("latlon", "latlona", "more", "all"),source = c("google", "dsk"), messaging = FALSE)
  housePrice<-data.frame(Name,price,coordinate)
  Buffalo_House=rbind(Buffalo_House,housePrice)
}
Buffalo_House
#getwd() 
write.table(Buffalo_House, file = "C:/Users/MaiBenBen/Desktop/finalproject1/Buffalo_House_example.txt")#the total data table can see in the UBlearns.  
#newtable<-read.table(file = "Buffalo_House.txt")
#newtable
#filter(Buffalo_House,lat<42.7)
#filter(Buffalo_House,lat>43.1)
```

## Including Plots
The example plot here:

```{r plot, echo=FALSE}
plot(x=Buffalo_House$lon,y=Buffalo_House$lat,ylab="latidute",xlab="longtiude",ylim=c(42.7,43.1),xlim=c(-78.7,-78.95))
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
